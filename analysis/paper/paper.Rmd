    The spread of new crops or species across areas during the Neolithic transition is one of the important archaeological issues to understand the process of adoption of new practices. It is widely accepted that mixed farming of rice/millet was introduced into Southwest China from Central and Northern China around 5000 BP. However, to what extent the new crops were utilized by local cultures in an earlier time remains unclear. The excavation of Guijiabao (ca. 5000-800 BP) in the Yanyuan basin in Southwest China uncovered abundant materials with well-preserved stratigraphic records, providing a unique opportunity to understand the local adoption of agriculture. To further understand pottery use and food practices at Guijiabao, we investigated organic residues preserved in potsherds through lipid biomarkers identification and compounds-specific stable isotope analysis. Our results show the signals of terrestrial animals for most potsherds with one showing a possible source from C3 plants during the Neolithic transition. Our case study indicates hunting might be the primary subsistence, supplemented by rice/millet farming, and also demonstrates a perspective from organic residue analysis to explore food consumption during the Neolithic period. A more systematic sampling of potsherds across different types and temporal phases with larger samples is needed to provide a clear picture of ancient diet and subsistence.

# Introduction
<!-- intro to the topic and research aim-->
Movements of people between geographically distinct areas usually accompany the exchange of goods, techniques, or ideas that could have cultural or economic impacts on those groups involved in the interaction [@Burmeister2000]. In southwestern China, the Hengduan Mountain ranges and valleys connecting the Tibetan Plateau and Yunnanâ€“Guizhou Plateau play an important role in the cultural exchange and spread of crops into this region and even further to mainland Southeast Asia [@Ma2021; @Lin2022; @Hao2022]. Despite a long-standing debate between rice/millet dispersal waves from northwest China and the middle Yangtze valley [@Guedes2013; @DAlpoim2018; @Liu2022], it is widely accepted that mixed farming spread to southwest Sichuan around 5,000 BP and to western Yunnan before 4600 BP [@Jiang2015; @YunnanMuseum1981; @Hao2022; @Chi2010; @Dal2022]. Therefore, the Neolithic Hengduan Mountain areas are key to understanding the processes of agriculture expansion. Recent archaeological evidence from the Yanyuan Basin, located in the middle Hengduan Mountains, reveals the introduction of cultivated millet and rice simultaneously during the early Neolithic period, similar to the mixed farming found in Neolithic central China [@Chen2015; @Hao2022; @Weisskopf2015]. However, how and to what extent the two crops were incorporated into the local cultures is still not fully understood.

To explore whether the new crops or species became important food sources during the Neolithic transition in the Yanyuan Basin, we investigated food residues from archaeological vessels at Guijiabao, a long-term occupation settlement with complete temporal sequences from the Neolithic period to the historical period in Yanyuan so far excavated [@Guijiabao2017a; @Guijiabao2020a]. The recent evidence at Guijiabao reveals millet as the main crop with little rice according to the results of flotation [@Guijiabao2016], different from the abundant rice grains found at other Neolithic sites in that area. Although the analysis of plant remains suggests millet/rice farming in the early Neolithic, we still lack direct evidence of culinary practices during this period. To understand the extent of new crops/species processing at Guijiabao, we ask the questions: What were the culinary practices reflected by pottery use? Could we identify the evidence of new crops or species incorporated into the local food choices in the Early Neolithic period? We answer those questions by examining potsherds using organic residue analysis, which allows us to directly explore food processed in ceramic vessels during the Neolithic transition in the Yanyuan Basin. 

The recent growing application of organic residue analysis demonstrates its usefulness to understand ancient pottery use and function [@Kimpe2004; @Mayyas2022], human subsistence strategies or culinary practices across a region or over time [@Kwak2020; @Craig2011; @Suryanarayan2021; @Zhang2022; @Junno2020]. Examining organic residues, particularly lipids, enables archaeologists to investigate ancient food practices through lipid distributions and specific lipid compounds as biomarkers to trace their original foodstuffs [@Copley2005; @Whelton2021]. This is because lipid molecules can be accumulated and well preserved in the porous fabric of pottery over thousand years due to the protection of clay matrices from microbiological degradation and water leaching [@Evershed1993; @Evershed2008; @Roffet2017]. In this study, we detect and identify lipid residues absorbed into the ceramic matrix that can reflect the original contents cooked or stored in a vessel during its use-life [@Dudd1999; @Miller2020]. We attempt to explore the culinary practice under the circumstances during the time of frequent cultural interactions and expansion of agriculture through our case study. 

# Geographical and Cultural Background of Guijiabao in Yanyuan Basin

<!--Yanyuan area and Guijiabao site-->
We focus on Guijiabao site located in the Yanyuan Basin, which is a pull-apart basin in the middle eastern part of the Hengduan Mountain ranges (Figure \@ref(fig:SW-china-map)). Guijiabao is especially unique due to its location as the intersection of the middle Hengduan Mountain ranges, the Sichuan Basin, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with a continuous occupation from the early Neolithic period to the historical period [@Guijiabao2017a; @Guijiabao2017b]. A survey in 2015 and subsequent excavations from 2016 to 2019 reveal abundant archaeological materials and features, such as semi-subterranean houses, ground houses, post holes, ash pits, ditches, and burials, suggesting that Guijiabao is a settlement site [@Hao2022]. The chronology of Guijiabao can be divided into three temporal phases, including the Neolithic period (5000-3700 BP), the Bronze Age (3200-2700 BP), and the late North Song to early Ming Dynasties (1200-500 BP) based on 19 radiocarbon dates from plant remains and a human bone [@Hao2022]. For the Neolithic period, it can be further separated into two subphases, 5000-4500 BP and 4500-3700 BP, according to the content of artifact assemblages and ceramic forms and styles. 

<!--the major finding at GJB-->
The common vessel forms unearthed at Guijiabao include jars, urns, bowls, and basins. The common ceramic styles in the early Neolithic period include grayish high-tempered fine ware and reddish brown coarse ware with surface decorations such as cord-marked and basket-impressed patterns [@Hao2022; @Guijiabao2017a]. Among the ceramics, incised geometric patterns and impressed dot patterns that resemble ceramic decorations found in western Yunnan, indicative of relationships between Guijiabao and sites in Yunnan [@Guijiabao2017a]. About the plant remains, the flotation analysis in 2015 reveal crop cultivation dominated by foxtail millet (*Setaria italica*) and broomcorn millet (*Panicum miliaceum*) based on samples collected from ash pits and stratigraphic layers [@Guijiabao2016]. This coresponds with a C4 based diet based on isotopic analysis on four human bones [@Lin2022]. The earliest domesticated millet grain can be traced back to 5000 BP according to its radiocarbon date [@Hao2022]. A smaller number of rice grains (*Oryza sativa*) have also been found in ash pits where the earliest one dates to 4700 BP [@Hao2022]. Later, a detailed phytolith analysis for soil samples dating to the Neolithic period (5000-3700 BP) further suggests the presence of rice phytoliths throughout the temporal sequences, indicative of a mixed millet/rice cultivation prior to 5000 BP [@Huan2022]. 

<!--info about Gaoshan-->
To have a comparison, we also look at a sample from Gaoshan in southwestern Chengdu Plain, which is an alluvial plain located between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan Plateau (Figure \@ref(fig:SW-china-map)). Excavations at Gaoshan revealed abundant materials, including ceramics, stone artifacts, animal and plant remains, and features such as house foundations, walls, burials, ash pits, ditches, and a well [@Gaoshan2017; @He2020; @JiangGaoshan2017; @ZhouGaoshan2015]. According to the pottery forms and decorations, Gaoshan can be categorized into the early Baodun period, the earliest Neolithic culture (ca. 4700-3700 BP) in the Chengdu Plain [@Guedes2013; @Gaoshan2017]. A large quantity of carbonized rice grains and isotopic analysis results suggests that rice is the main crop supplemented by millets [@JiangGaoshan2017; @Lee2020]. This also indicates the spread of rice cultivation from the Middle and Lower Yangzi valley to Sichuan in southwest China occurred at least 4500 years ago [@Chi2010]. Moreover, recent research on animal bones in 2015 and 2016 shows the predominance of domesticated pigs, with a small number of domesticated dogs [@He2020]. The primary subsistence strategy at Gaoshan could be rice cultivation with pig husbandry, supplemented by millet cultivation. 

Although the current finding at Guijiabao and Gaoshan support the spread of mixed farming of millet/rice into southwest China around 5000 BP, what their proportions are in local culinary practices during the early time remains unclear. For example, the analysis of plant remains and phytolith analysis for Guijiabao show that millet is the major crop, which is at odds with the predominance of rice in the neighboring sites, such as Gaoshan, Baodun, Henglanshan, and Baiyangcun in Sichuan and Yunnan [@Hao2022; @Guedes2013]. The analysis of plant remains offers information on the adoption of crop cultivation and subsistence strategies, but evidence directly reflects food preparation or processing using ceramics still lacks. This study aims to provide direct evidence from food residues in ceramics to investigate culinary practices associated with the cultivation of new crops.

# Materials and methods

## Samples
We selected six ceramic fragments from Guijiabao and Gaoshan for organic residue analysis (Table \@ref(tab:sherds-table)). Four ceramic fragments from Guijiabao were recovered from trench 13 excavated in the 2017 field season and one fragment was from the 2016 season. Those potsherds can be divided into two temporal phases, the early Neolithic period (ca. 4500 BP) and the historical period (ca. 1000 BP). Our samples are mostly grayish base fragments with fine sand temper and a number of them have impressed decoration. Although their original forms could not be recovered, those ceramics are supposed to be used in daily life according to the evidence of chars on some fragments and their archaeological contexts in cultural layers [@Hao2022; @Guijiabao2017a]. This research also attempts to confirm that those ceramics were used as cooking/storage wares for food.

```

## Methods
For organic residue analysis, we detected and identified lipid compounds by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and quantify lipids by gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID). To distinguish the source of the common fatty acids, palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0), found in most animals and plants, we determined their stable carbon isotope characteristics by gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). The stable carbon isotope ratio for individual lipid compounds is a powerful indicator of the origins of organic residues since different food categories, such as terrestrial animals, marine animals, and plants, have specific ranges of Î´^13^C values [@Craig2004; @Craig2007; @Evershed1994]. 

For the sample processing, we cleaned the surface of each potsherd to prevent external contamination from environmental factors and handling during excavation or post-excavation analysis. Approximately 3.5 grams powdered samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol solution (9:1 v/v) using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE Dionex 350; at 100 degrees C). We conducted saponification by adding 10 mL 1M KOH in methanol and 1 mL water into the extracts and heated them in an oven at 70 degrees C overnight. Saponified extracts were acidified with 6M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and the acid fraction was extracted using hexane ($3\times10$ mL). A 5% aliquot of each sample was derivatized using 20 uL N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% v/v trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), and heated at 70 degrees C for one hour. After drying under a stream of nitrogen, the derivatized sample was dissolved in toluene (20 uL) prior to GC-MS. Internal standards were added before and after the total lipid extraction. 

The remaining 95% aliquot was fractioned by solid phase extraction (Aminopropyl, NH2, column with 0.5 g sorbent) with 8 mL dichloromethane:Isopropyl alcohol (3:1), 8 mL 4% acetic acid in ethyl ether, and 6 mL methanol respectively. The second fraction was methylated to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with 1 mL dry hexane and 2 mL 10% (v/v) acetyl chloride in dry methanol, and heated at 70 degrees C overnight. The FAME derivatives were extracted with hexane ($3\times10$ mL) and blown down with nitrogen streams. About 5% aliquot dissolved in toluene was analyzed by GC-FID for quantification and the remaining was analyzed by GC-C-IRMS.  

The GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7683 B series gas chromatograph attached to an Agilent 5975 inert mass selective detector. Samples were injected in splitless mode at 320 Â°C and compounds were separated with a VF-17ms column (60 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Î¼m film thickness). Helium carrier is in constant flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The temperature of the oven was started from 90 Â°C for 1 minute and increased at a rate of 5 Â°C/min to 320 Â°C, where it was held for 23 min. The GC-FID analysis for the FAME samples was carried out using Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a PTV inlet in splitless mode. The carrier gas was helium at 1.6 ml/min. The GC system was an Agilent 6890N equipped with a programmed temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet in splitless mode. The GC oven was held at 90Â°C for 1.3 minute, and then raised to 320Â°C at a rate of 5Â°C/min. The final temperature was held for 22 minutes. The GC-C-IRMS analyses of FAMEs of individual fatty acids were conducted using a Thermo Delta V Plus mass spectrometer linked to a GC Trace 1310 through an Isolink Interface. The sample injection volume was 1 ul in toluene and was injected in splitless mode. Separation was carried out using the same model of column for GC-MS and the GC oven temperature was set from 90 Â°C for 1.5 minutes, and then raised at a rate of 5 Â°C/min to 320 Â°C, with an 18-minute hold. Helium was used as a gas carrier in constant flow mode at 1.24 ml/minute.

The GC-MS analysis for organic residues extracted from Guijiabao and Gaoshan potsherds revealed the presence of lipid compounds above interpretable concentrations (5 Î¼g/g) [@Evershed2008experimental], but with low amounts in most of them (Table \@ref(tab:FA-composition-table)). The lipid profiles show that the saturated fatty acids with an even number of carbons, particularly C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), and monounsaturated fatty acid C18:1 (oleic acid), are the main compounds in most potsherds (Figure \@ref(fig:chromatograms-plots-four)). Those fatty acids commonly exist in animal fat and plant oil. They are also generally degraded from other larger molecules such as triacylglycerols due to oxidation and microbial degradation after long-term burial processes [@Dudd1998; @Eerkens2007]. High concentrations of Medium-chain fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0) with an even-over-old carbon chain length predominance indicate that the organic residues in our potsherds were highly degraded during post-depositional processes. In addition, a number of potsherds present higher contents of C18:1 compared to C18:0 and C16:0, such as SYG-TN13-E23-3. Although a larger content of C18:1 and C16:0 with smaller content of C18:0 might indicate an origin of plant oils [@Mayyas2018; @Copley2005], it is hard to directly relate the pattern we observed to a plant origin based on GC-MS results alone.

One pottery sample (SYG-TN13-E22-2#2) has much higher lipid concentrations (about `r FA_max_sum` Î¼g/g) than the rest of the sample, suggesting a better preservation of lipids that might relate to the type of the ceramic or a different use. This sample also has charred interior surface, indicating its function to be associated with food processing. Long-chain fatty acids from C20:0 to C32:0 are present in that sample with an even-over-odd carbon chain length predominance, but in lower abundance than the medium-chain components (Figure \@ref(fig:chromatograms-specific)). The existence of long-chain fatty acids with a high abundance of C16:0 relative to C18:0 might be related to plant waxes [@Post1996; @Copley2005]. However, it could be also associated with degraded animal fat based on a strong predominance of medium-chain fatty acids [@Whelton2018; @Dudd1998]. Overall, the GC-MS results demonstrate strong evidence of degraded animal fats.

To identify the origins of degraded animal fats, we conducted isotope analysis to obtain the stable carbon isotope compositions Î´^13^C values of C16:0 and C18:0 using GC-C-IRMS. The Î´^13^C values of C16:0 and C18:0 have proven useful to distinguish between ruminant adipose, non-ruminant adipose, and ruminant dairy fats based on different ways where dietary carbon sources are utilized by different fat types [@Dunne2012; @Copley2003; @Evershed2008]. To reduce the bias caused by differential Î´^13^C values across geographical regions, we used the Î”^13^C(Î´^13^C18:0 - Î´^13^C16:0) values to determine the sources of degraded fats [@Evershed2008; @Salque2013]. The carbon isotope values for C16:0 and C18:0 distribute between `r min_carbon_isotope` and `r max_carbon_isotope`, and their Î”13C values range from `r delta_min` â€° to `r delta_max` â€°. The Î”13C values were plotted according to the global reference database for the identification of their origins [@Suryanarayan2021; @Dunne2012; @Evershed2008]. 

The results show that most potsherd samples from Guijiabao contain fatty acids from ruminant adipose fats with one potsherd (SYG-TN13-E23-3) suggesting an origin of non-ruminant adipose fat (Figure \@ref(fig:isotopic-plots): A). The potsherd from Gaushan (CDG-062) demonstrates ruminant adipose fats as well. A number of potsherds (SYG-TN13-E22-1 and SYG-3) from Guijiabao dating to the historical period plotted between the reference line of ruminant adipose and non-ruminant, indicative of the mixing of those two origins [@Copley2003; @Dudd1998milk; @Suryanarayan2021]. Moreover, the potsherd indicating non-ruminant adipose fats has a relatively depleted Î´^13^C value (Figure \@ref(fig:isotopic-plots): B) falling within the range of C3/terrestrial plants or freshwater fish [@Shoda2018; @Kwak2020]. This also corresponds to the lipid distribution of the same potsherd which reflects a possible plant origin based on the GC-MS results. Although the referenced isotopic values should be ideally adjusted in terms of local environments, they could still provide useful information for accessing food categories. 

In general, most potsherd samples containing ruminant adipose fats have depleted Î´^13^C values consistent with the Î´^13^C values of C3/terrestrial plants, suggesting the ruminant animals were likely fed on C3 plants. There is only one potsherd (SYG-TN13-E22-2#2) have a relatively enriched Î´^13^C value, indicative of a C4 plant diet for the ruminant animal.

# Discussion
<!--A brief summary of interesting results-->
Our results show that food choices indicated by lipid residues extracted from Guijiabao and Gaoshan potsherds were mainly dominated by ruminant fats during the Neolithic period. Moreover, it is striking to identify a non-ruminant source from a Guijiabao potsherd that might originate from C3 plants. Although the lipid yields in most of our samples are generally low, interpretative amounts of yields from all of our samples support that those ceramics were used as cooking or storage pots. The low yield might be related to the part of pottery samples analyzed in this study are mostly base fragments [@Evershed2008experimental; @Kwak2020]. But we also found a base sample dating to the early Neolithic period contains a rich composition of long-chain fatty acids, reflecting good preservation. We recognize limitations and challenges for interpreting lipid source over time or differences across regions due to our small sample sizes and a lack of local modern references for animal fats and plants. However, the general pattern of the isotopic values of lipid molecules could still provide informative clues for a better understanding of culinary practices or the local subsistence at Guijiabao.

<!--discussion about possible plant origins-->
One aim of our study is to explore whether new crops, such as C3 plants (eg. rice), C4 plants (eg. millets), or new species (eg. pigs/horses) became an essential part of the local diet in Yanyuan during the Neolithic transition. We successfully identified non-ruminant fats from a Guijiabao potsherd that might be from terrestrial plant/C3 plants based on similar isotopic values reported by other studies in East Asia [@Shoda2018; @Kwak2020]. It is also possible other native grasses classified as C3 plants, such as pennisetum and chenopodiaceae, were part of the local diet [@Guijiabao2016]. However, the seeds of wild weeds only account for a small part of plant remains. Surprisingly, we only observed signals of C3 plants, despite the fact that C4 plants (foxtail and broomcorn millets) are the major crop based on the recent macro-botanical and phytolith studies at Guijiabao [@Guijiabao2016; @Hao2022; @Huan2022]. Freshwater fish could be another origin of non-ruminant fats based on the finding of fish bones and net sinkers at Guijiabao [@Lucquin2016; @Guijiabao2017b], but we did not detect any presence of biomarkers for aquatic resources, such as long-chain $\omega$-(o-alkylphenyl) alkanoic acids or phytanic acid from our potsherds [@Evershed2008marine; @Hansel2004; @Cramp2014; @Kwak2017].  

<!--discussion about possible ruminant fat origin-->
Ruminant fats identified in the Neolithic potsherds (ca. 4500 BP) from Guijiabao and Gaoshan could be derived from deer or horse according to unearthed faunal remains from the sites, accompanied with stone tools for hunting, such as stone balls and arrow-heads [@Hao2022; @Guijiabao2020a]. But whether horse was part of local food choices in the Neolithic period is questionable. First, the Pleistocene and Neolithic sites with wild horse bones primarily concentrated in northern China [@Yuan2006]. Second, domesticated horses first found in southwest China were much later from the Dian culture (4th century BC to 1st century AD) in eastern Yunnan [@Lei2009; @Chiou2004]. The evidence from Guijiabao also confirms a later presence of horse remains. In addition, one potsherd (SYG-TN13-E22-2#1) shows the isotopic value consistent with those values of deer and sheep fats fed on a C3 diet based on global references [@Evershed2002]. It is also possible that other ruminant animals, such as wild Asian water buffalo or yak, were part of food sources during this period [@Zhang2016]. A detailed analysis of faunal remains from Guijiabao is still in progress that can provide further information. 

We observed a mixture of ruminant fats and terrestrial plants based on a number of Guijiabao potsherds dating to the historical period (ca. 1000 BP). However, we are unable to determine whether there is a shift in diet over time due to our limited sample size. But the overall depleted Î´^13^C values for most potsherds suggest that C3 plants might be an important diet for local animals and could also be included in the local diet in Yanyuan during the Neolithic transition. This corresponds with the timing when new crops were introduced into southwest China. Despite no C4 plant origin was found, one potsherd shows the signal of C4 plant-fed ruminant. In general, the food source detected from our samples comprised mainly of ruminant fats that are more likely from wildlife. This might be related to local ecological zones and environments where wild animals were easier to obtained compared widely adoption of agriculture. Since zooarchaeological analysis and studies of other artifacts such as stone tools are still in progress, we could only rely on preliminary excavation reports with preliminary results of other lines of evidence. A large-scale organic residue analysis of ceramics across different pottery forms in a wider region may offer insight into temporal and regional variations in food choices during the Neolithic transition.

# Conclusion
Our case study on organic residues preserved in pottery fragments from Guijiabao and Gaoshan in southwest China reveals the presence of lipids but in low concentrations for most potsherds. The food cooked in those ceramics include ruminant fats and terrestrial plants during the Neolithic transition when the mixing farming of rice/millet spread into southwest China. It is most likely the terrestrial plant signal from C3 plant, implying rice processing in the pot. However, the evidence of direct processing of terrestrial plants is not as much as we expected according to a relatively large quantity of plant remains found at Guijiabao, such as millet grains. Instead, food processing in the early Neolithic is mostly ruminant fats that could originate from local wild animals, such as deer. This indicates that the proportion of rice/millet in the local diet is not high during the Neolithic transition, suggesting that hunting might be the primary subsistence, supplemented by rice/millet farming. We recognize the limitation of our interpretation of the local diet due to the small sample size. However, our study can still offer a perspective from organic residue analysis to explore food preferences and the extent of farming adoption when rice/millet agriculture first spread into the Yanyuan during the Neolithic period. A more systematic sampling of potsherds across different phases and pottery types may eliminate a clear picture of diet and subsistence during the Neolithic transition.
