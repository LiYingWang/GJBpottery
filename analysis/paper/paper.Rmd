# Introduction
<!-- intro to the topic and research aim-->
Movements of people between geographically distinct areas usually accompany the exchange or introduction of goods, species, and ideas that could result in far-reaching impacts on local societies economically and culturally. In Southwest China, the Hengduan Mountain ranges as natural passes play an important role in the migration of farming communities and the spread of crops into this region and mainland Southeast Asia. Recent archaeological evidence from the Yanyuan Basin, located in the middle Hengduan Mountains, reveals the introduction of cultivated millet and rice simultaneously during the early Neolithic period, similar to the mixed farming found in Neolithic central China [@Chen2015; @Hao2022]. However, how and to what extent the two crops were incorporated into the local cultures is still not fully understood. To explore whether the new species became main food sources during the Neolithic transition in the Yanyuan Basin, we investigated food residues from archaeological vessels at Guijiabao, the oldest Neolithic site in the Yanyuan region so far excavated.  

<!-- sites and research questions-->
As an early Neolithic site, Guijiabao (ca. 4800-4300 BP) is crucial to understanding cultural interactions and the spread of crops into the Yanyuan Basin due to its location at the intersection of the middle Hengduan Mountain ranges, the Sichuan Plateau, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The recent evidence at Guijiabao reveals millet as the main crop with little rice according to the results of flotation [@citation], different from the abundant rice grains found at other Neolithic sites in that area. Although the plant remains suggest the possible domestication of millet in the early Neolithic, we still lack direct evidence of culinary practices during the Neolithic transition. To explore the extent of acceptance of new crops and species in the Yanyuan Basin, we ask the questions: What was the culinary practices during the Neolithic transition? Could we identify the evidence of new crops or species incorporated into the local dietary systems in the Early Neolithic period? We answer those questions by examining potsherds collected from Guijiabao using organic residue analysis, which could offer a better understanding of food sources during the Neolithic transition in the Yanyuan Basin. 

This study aims to detect and identify organic residues, particularly lipid residues, that could have been preserved in the ceramic fabric to explore the vessel usage at Guijiabao. Lipid analysis is useful in archaeology since lipid molecules can be well preserved over thousand years in the porous fabric of pottery with the protection of clay matrices from microbiological degradation and water leaching [@Evershed1993; @Evershed2008; @Roffet2017]. Lipid residues are the most direct evidence to investigate culinary practices and dietary patterns since specific lipid compounds can be associated with different types of foodstuffs cooked or stored in pottery vessels [@Copley2005]. It is especially informative for human subsistence in the situation where archaeological sites lack organic remains due to acidic sediments [@Kwak2020]. The growing application of organic residue analysis demonstrate it offers a better understanding of culinary practices during the transitional period to agricultural societies [@Craig2011], dietary patterns in

# Geographical and Cultural Background of Guijiabao in Yanyuan Basin
<!--Info about Yanyuan area-->
The Yanyuan area in Sichuan province is a pull-apart basin located in the middle eastern part of the Hengduan Mountain, which is a group of parallel mountain ranges in a north-south direction from the Tibetan Plateau to Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Although the ranges isolate areas with their own unique geographic conditions and cultures, river valleys provide pathways for the movements of people and the exchange of goods between cultural groups since the prehistoric period [@Lin2022; @Hao2022]. The archaeological sites in the Yanyuan Basin, therefore, are important to understanding the cultural interactions between southwest China and other regions, including northwest China, the Sichuan area, and northwest Yunnan. 

<!--Info about Guijiabao-->
Among those archaeological sites in Yanyuan, Guijiabao located in the southwestern part of the Basin is the only site with continuous occupation from the early Neolithic period to the historical period. The chronology of Guijiabao can be divided into three temporal phases based on 19 radiocarbon dates from plant remains and a human bone, including the Neolithic period (5000-3700 BP.), the Bronze Age (3200-2700 BP.), and the late North Song to early Ming Dynasties (1200-500 BP.) [@Hao2022]. The Neolithic period can be further separated into two subphases, 5000-4500 cal. BP and 4500-3700 cal. BP, according to the cultural remains and pottery characteristics. Recent archaeological evidence indicates the spread of millet-rice mixed economy to southwest Sichuan can be dated back to around 5,000 BP.
 
# Materials and methods

## Samples
We selected five ceramic fragments (Table XX) from Guijiabao for organic residue analysis, in which four samples were recovered from the trench 13 excavated in the 2017 field season and one sample was from the 2016 season. To further investigate the content and use of pottery vessels in an earlier period, we focus on potsherds excavated from the stratigraphic layer which dates to the early Neolithic period (5000-4500 BP.). During this period, the common vessel forms include jars, urns, bowls, and basins. For the pottery types, cord-marked grey pottery vessels with fine inclusions and cord-marked sand-tempered vessels in reddish-brown color with coarse inclusions are the two dominant types [@Hao2022]. Our samples are jar fragments from those two common types supposed to be used for food serving or storage according to their archaeological context that suggests living area []. 

## Methods
In this study, we detected and identified lipid compounds by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and quantify lipids by gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID). To distinguish the source of the common fatty acids, palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0), found in most animals and plants, we determined their stable carbon isotope characteristics by gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). The stable carbon isotope ratio for individual lipid compounds is powerful indicator of the origins of organic residues since different food categories, such as terrestrial or marine animals and plants, have specific ranges of δ^13^C values [@Evershed1994]. 

We cleaned the surface of each potsherd to prevent external contamination from environmental factors and handling during excavation or post-excavation analysis. Approximately 3.5 grams powdered samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol solution (9:1 v/v) using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE Dionex 350; at 100 degrees C). We conducted saponification by adding 10 mL 1M KOH in methanol and 1 mL water into the extracts and heated them in an oven at 70 degrees C overnight. Saponified extracts were acidified with 6M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and the acid fraction was extracted using hexane ($3\times10$ mL). A 5% aliquot of each sample was derivatized using 20 uL N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% v/v trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), and heated at 70 degrees C for one hour. After drying under a stream of nitrogen, the derivitized sample was dissolved in toluene (20 uL) prior to GC-MS. 

The remaining 95% aliquot was fractioned by solid phase extraction (Aminopropyl, NH2, column with 0.5 g sorbent) with 8 mL dichloromethane:Isopropyl alcohol (3:1), 8 mL 4% acetic acid in ethyl ether, and 6 mL methanol respectively. The second fraction was methylated to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using 1 mL dry hexane and 2 mL 10% (v/v) acetyl chloride in dry methanol, and heated at 70 degree C overnight. The FAME derivatives were extracted with hexane ($3\times10$ mL) and blown down with nitrogen stream. About 5% aliquot dissolved in toluene was analyzed by GC-FID and the remaining sample was analyzed by GC-C-IRMS. 

To further distinguish the source of fatty acids, we conducted stable carbon isotope analysis for those samples.

The GC-MS analysis for organic residues extracted from Guijiabao and Gaoshan potsherds revealed the presence of lipid compounds above interpretable concentrations (5 μg/g) [@Evershed2008experimental], but with low amounts in most of them (Table \@ref(tab:FA-composition-table)). The lipid profiles show that the saturated fatty acids with an even number of carbons, particularly C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), and monounsaturated fatty acid C18:1 (oleic acid), are the main compounds in most potsherds (Figure \@ref(fig:chromatograms-plots-four)). Those fatty acids commonly exist in animal fat and plant oil. They are also generally degraded from other larger molecules such as triacylglycerols due to oxidation and microbial degradation after long-term burial processes [@Dudd1998; @Eerkens2007]. High concentrations of C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids in our samples suggest that the original organic residues were highly degraded during post-depositional processes. In addition, some potsherds present higher contents of C18:1 compared to C18:0 and C16:0, such as SYG-TN13-E23-3. A larger content of C18:1 and C16:0 with smaller content of C18:0 might indicate an origin of plant oils [@Mayyas2018; @Copley2005]. Although oleic acid (C18:1) is the most abundant compound for most of our samples, the generally low concentrations of all fatty acids with minor differences in their amounts may not fully support a plant origin.

Long-chain fatty acids from C20:0 to C32:0 are present in only one pottery sample (SYG-TN13-E22-2#2) with an even-over-odd carbon chain length predominance, but in lower abundance than the medium-chain components (Figure \@ref(fig:chromatograms-specific)). The existence of long-chain fatty acids with a high abundance of C16:0 relative to C18:0 might be related to plant waxes [@Post1996; @Copley2005]. However, it could be also associated with degraded animal fat based on a strong predominance of medium-chain fatty acids [@Whelton2018; @Dudd1998]. Overall, the GC-MS results demonstrate strong evidence of degraded animal fats.

To identify the origins of degraded animal fats, we conducted isotope analysis to obtain the stable carbon isotope compositions δ^13^C values of C16:0 and C18:0 using GC-C-IRMS. The δ^13^C values of C16:0 and C18:0 have proven useful to distinguish between ruminant adipose, non-ruminant adipose, and ruminant dairy fats based on different ways where dietary carbon sources are utilized by different fat types [@Dunne2012; @Copley2003; @Evershed2008]. To reduce the bias caused by differential δ^13^C values across geographical regions, we used the Δ^13^C(δ^13^C18:0 - δ^13^C16:0) values to determine the sources of degraded fats [@Evershed2008; @Salque2013]. The carbon isotope values for C16:0 and C18:0 distribute between `r min_carbon_isotope` and `r max_carbon_isotope`, and their Δ13C values range from `r delta_min` ‰ to `r delta_max` ‰. The Δ13C values were plotted according to the global reference database for the identification of their origins [@Suryanarayan2021; @Dunne2012; @Evershed2008]. 

The results show that most potsherd samples from Guijiabao contain fatty acids from ruminant adipose fats with one potsherd (SYG-TN13-E23-3) suggesting an origin of non-ruminant adipose fat (Figure \@ref(fig:isotopic-plots): A). The only potsherd from Gaushan (CDG-062) demonstrates ruminant adipose fats as well. It should be noted that there are two potsherds (SYG-TN13-E22-1 and SYG-3) from Guijiabao plotted between the reference line of ruminant adipose and non-ruminant, indicative of the mixing of those two sources [@Copley2003]. Moreover, the potsherd indicating non-ruminant adipose fats has a relatively depleted δ^13^C value (Figure \@ref(fig:isotopic-plots): B) falling within the range of C3/terrestrial plants [@Shoda2018; @Kwak2020]. In general, most potsherd samples containing ruminant adipose fats have depleted δ^13^C values consistent with the δ^13^C values of C3/terrestrial plants, suggesting the ruminant animals were likely fed on C3 plants. There is only one potsherd (SYG-TN13-E22-2#2) have a relatively enriched δ^13^C value, indicative of a C4 plant diet for the ruminant animal.

# Discussion
The results show a mixture of C3 plants, such as rice, and terrestrial animals for most pots with one pot showing more C4 plant source or marine source. Our striking finding might suggest that consumption of rice could be part of the daily life at Guijiabao and the adoption of rice agriculture could be as important as millet cultivation which was thought the main crop previously. Our next steps is to increase sample size to include pots from different time periods and different types of pottery to identify any variation through time and also try different methods, such as phytolith analysis to further support our statement about rice cultivation.

# Conclusion
Our investigation on the ceramics excavated from Southwest China suggests that a mixture of C3 plants and ruminant animals could be the food sources in this region during the Neolithic transition. This case study not only indicates the possibility of rice agriculture that has not been identified previously at the site but also demonstrates the first use of lipid analysis for pottery to explore the diet of the late Neolithic period in this region.
