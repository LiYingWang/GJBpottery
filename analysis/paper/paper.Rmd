    The spread of new crops or terrestial animals across areas in southwest China during the Neolithic period is one of the important archaeological issues to understand the process of adoption of new culinary practices in those areas. It is widely accepted that both millet and rice were introduced into southwest China in 4700 BP at the latest. However, to what extent new crops were used by local peoples at an earlier time remains unclear. The excavation of Guijiabao in the Yanyuan basin in southwest China uncovered abundant materials with well-preserved stratigraphic records and has provided a unique opportunity to understand the local adoption of new crops. To further understand pottery use and food practices at Guijiabao, we investigated organic residues preserved in potsherds using lipid biomarker identification and compounds-specific stable isotope analysis. The results show signals of terrestrial animals in most potsherds and a C3 plant source in one potshard, during the Neolithic period. Our case study indicates that hunting might have been the primary means for obtaining subsistence, supplemented by rice/millet farming. This study also demonstrates an approach using organic residue analysis to explore pottery use and culinary practices during the Neolithic period in southwest China. A more systematic sampling of different types of potsherds and temporal phases with larger samples is needed to provide a clearer picture of ancient diets and subsistence.

# Introduction
<!-- intro to the topic and research aim-->
Movements of people between geographically distinct areas are usually accompanied by the exchange of goods, technology, or ideas that could have cultural or economic impacts on any people groups that are involved in the interactions that result from these movements [@Burmeister2000]. The Hengduan Mountain ranges and valleys in southwestern China are geographical areas that connect the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Yunnanâ€“Guizhou Plateau and by which movement to these plateaus must occur. They play an important role in the cultural exchanges and spread of crops into southwestern China and even further to mainland Southeast Asia [@Ma2021; @Lin2022; @Hao2022; @Tong1986]. Despite a long-standing debate on the routes of rice/millet dispersal from northwest China and the middle Yangtze valley to southwestern China [@Guedes2013; @DAlpoim2018; @Liu2022], it is widely accepted that mixed farming was practiced in southwest Sichuan around 4700 BP and in western Yunnan before 4600 BP [@Jiang2016; @YunnanMuseum1981; @Hao2022; @Zhang2010; @Dal2022; @Chen2015]. The Hengduan Mountain regions in the Neolithic period are therefore essential for understanding the processes of agricultural expansion. Recent archaeological evidence from the Yanyuan Basin in the middle Hengduan Mountains further reveals that millet and rice were present at roughly the same period as the grains found in Sichuan [@Huan2022; @Hao2022]. However, to what extent the two crops were incorporated into the local diet is still not fully understood.

To explore whether new crops or terrestrial animals became important food sources during the Neolithic period in the Yanyuan Basin, we investigated food residues within ceramic vessels from Guijiabao, a long-term occupation settlement with complete temporal sequences from the Neolithic period to the historical period in Yanyuan that have been excavated so far [@Guijiabao2017a; @Guijiabao2020a]. The new evidence at Guijiabao reveals that millet and rice were both present there in the Neolithic period around 5000 BP, earlier than previously thought [@Guijiabao2016], and millet could have already been part of the local diet [@Lin2022]. Although some of these analyses suggest the presence of mixed millet/rice farming, we still lack direct evidence of culinary practices during this period. To understand the extent of consuming new crops or terrestrial animals at Guijiabao, we ask the questions: What were the culinary practices that can be deduced by the pottery? Can we identify the new crops or terrestrial animals that were incorporated into the local food diets during the Neolithic period? We answer these questions by examining potsherds using organic residue analysis, which allows us to directly explore food cooked or processed in ceramic vessels.

The recent growing application of organic residue analysis demonstrates its usefulness in understanding ancient pottery use [@Kimpe2004; @Mayyas2022], human subsistence strategies, or culinary practices across a region over time [@Kwak2020; @Craig2011; @Suryanarayan2021; @Zhang2022; @Junno2020]. Examining organic residues, particularly lipids, enables archaeologists to investigate ancient food practices through lipid distributions and specific lipid compounds as biomarkers for tracing food origins [@Copley2005; @Whelton2021]. This is possible due to the protection of clay matrices from microbiological degradation and water leaching, which allows lipid molecules to accumulate and be well preserved in the porous fabric of pottery for over a thousand years [@Evershed1993; @Evershed2008; @Roffet2017]. In this study, we detected and identified lipid residues absorbed into the ceramic matrix that can reveal the original contents cooked or stored in a vessel during its lifetime of use [@Dudd1999; @Miller2020]. Through our case study, We attempt to investigate culinary practices during a period of frequent cultural interactions that accompanied agricultural expansion .

<!--Yanyuan area and Guijiabao site-->
We focus on the Guijiabao site located in the Yanyuan Basin, which is a pull-apart basin in the middle eastern part of the Hengduan Mountain ranges (Figure \@ref(fig:SW-china-map)). The Guijiabao site allows us to understand the early adoption of agriculturebecause of its uniqueness and rarity: it contains complete cultural components from the Neolithic period to the historical period in that region [@Guijiabao2017a; @Guijiabao2017b]. A survey in 2015 and subsequent excavations from 2016 to 2019 revealed abundant archaeological materials and features, such as semi-subterranean houses, ground houses, post holes, ash pits, ditches, and burials, suggesting that Guijiabao was a settlement site [@Hao2022]. The chronology of the Guijiabao site can be divided into three phases, the Neolithic period (5000-3700 BP), the Bronze Age (3200-2700 BP), and the late North Song to early Ming dynasties (1200-500 BP) based on 19 radiocarbon dates from plant remains and a human bone. For the Neolithic period, it can be further divided into two subphases, 5000-4500 BP and 4500-3700 BP, according to the content of artifact assemblages and ceramic forms and styles that were identified [@Hao2022].

<!--the major finding at GJB-->
The common vessel forms unearthed at the Guijiabao site include jars, urns, bowls, and basins. The representative ceramic styles in the Neolithic period are grayish high-tempered fine ware and reddish brown coarse ware with decorations such as cord-marked and basket-impressed patterns [@Hao2022; @Guijiabao2017a]. Some ceramic decorations present northern styles, and some ceramics with incised geometric patterns and impressed dot patterns resemble those found in western Yunnan, indicative of relationships between the Guijiabao site and sites in Yunnan and the southern part of the Hengduan Mountains [@Guijiabao2017a]. Plant remains reveal that cultivated crops were dominated by foxtail millet (*Setaria italica*) and broomcorn millet (*Panicum miliaceum*) based on flotation samples collected from ash pits and stratigraphic layers that can be traced back to 5000 BP [@Guijiabao2016; @Hao2022]. This corresponds to a C4-based diet based on isotopic analysis of four human bones [@Lin2022]. In addition to millet, a smaller number of rice grains (*Oryza sativa*) has also been found in ash pits, where the earliest one dates to 4700 BP [@Hao2022]. A detailed phytolith analysis for soil samples dating to the Neolithic period (5000-3700 BP) further suggests the presence of rice phytoliths throughout the temporal sequences [@Huan2022].

<!--info about Gaoshan-->
To compare the culinary practices in different ecological zones, we examined a sample from the Gaoshan site in the southwestern Chengdu Plain, an alluvial plain in the western Sichuan Basin at the foot of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Figure \@ref(fig:SW-china-map)). Excavations at the Gaoshan site reveal abundant materials, including ceramics, stone artifacts, animal and plant remains, and archaeological features such as house foundations, walls, burials, ash pits, ditches, and a well [@Gaoshan2017; @He2020; @JiangGaoshan2017; @ZhouGaoshan2015]. According to similar pottery forms and styles, the Gaoshan site can be dated to the early Baodun period, the earliest Neolithic culture (ca. 4700-3700 BP) in the Chengdu Plain [@Gaoshan2017]. The primary subsistence strategy at the Gaoshan site could have been rice cultivation with pig husbandry, supplemented by millet cultivation [@JiangGaoshan2017; @Lee2020; @He2020]. It is suggested that the spread of rice farming into the Sichuan area occurred at least 4700 years ago from people moving from the Middle and Lower Yangzi valleys to the Sichuan area [@Zhang2010].

Although the recent findings at the Guijiabao and Gaoshan sites support mixed agriculture as the primary subsistence strategy, it is still unclear how much millet or rice was included in the local diets during the Neolithic period. The macro-botanical and phytolith analyses of the Guijiabao site show that millet was the major crop, similar to the findings at the Yingpanshan site in Sichuan [@Zhao2011]. However, plant remains from many sites in southwest China reveal a predominance of rice, such as at the Gaoshan and Baodun sites in Sichuan [@JiangGaoshan2017] and at Henglanshan and Baiyangcun sites in Yunnan [@Jiang2016; @Henglanshan2014]. This indicates that there were variations in agricultural practices in southwest China. To better understand the extent of the adoption of new crops, organic residue analysis of ceramics is a useful approach since we can directly study food residues related to culinary practices, including food preparation, processing, and cooking. This provides another way to examine the expansion of agriculture in the Yanyuan area.

# Materials and methods

## Samples
We selected ceramic fragments that were identified as typical from the Guijiabao and Gaoshan sites. The fragments date to the Neolithic (around 4500 BP) and historical (around 1000 BP) (Table \@ref(tab:sherds-table)), which were determined from known contexts based on radiocarbon dating. Ceramic fragments from the Guijiabao site were excavated from trench 13 excavated during the 2017 field season, along with one fragment from the 2016 season. The pottery samples are mostly gray base fragments with fine sand temper, of which a few have impressed decorations. Although their original forms could not be recovered, the evidence of chars on some fragments and their contexts in cultural layers suggest that these ceramics were used in daily life [@Guijiabao2017a; @Hao2022]. This research also attempts to confirm that these pottery vessels were used as cooking/storage wares for food.

```

## Methods
We detected and identified lipid compounds using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified lipids using gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID). To distinguish the source of the common fatty acids, palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0), which are found in most animals and plants, we identified their stable carbon isotope characteristics using gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). The stable carbon isotope ratio for individual lipid compounds is a powerful indicator of the origins of fatty acids since different food categories, such as terrestrial animals, marine animals, and plants, have specific ranges of Î´^13^C values [@Craig2004; @Craig2007; @Evershed1994]. 

For sample processing, the surface of each potsherd was removed to prevent external contamination from environmental factors and handling during excavation or post-excavation analysis. Approximately 3.5 grams of powdered samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol solution (9:1 v/v) using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE Dionex 350; at 100 Â°C). We conducted saponification by adding 10 mL of 1M KOH in methanol and 1 mL water to the extracts and heating them in an oven at 70 Â°C overnight. Saponified extracts were acidified with 6M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and the acid fraction was extracted using hexane ($3\times10$ mL). A 5% aliquot of each sample was derivatized using 20 uL N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% v/v trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), and heated at 70 Â°C for one hour. After drying under a stream of nitrogen, the derivatized sample was dissolved in toluene (20 uL) prior to GC-MS. 

The remaining 95% aliquot was fractioned using solid phase extraction (Aminopropyl, NH2, column with 0.5 g sorbent) with 8 mL dichloromethane:Isopropyl alcohol (3:1), 8 mL 4% acetic acid in ethyl ether, and 6 mL methanol. The second fraction was methylated to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with 1 mL dry hexane and 2 mL 10% (v/v) acetyl chloride in dry methanol, and heated at 70 Â°C overnight. The FAME derivatives were extracted with hexane ($3\times10$ mL) and then blown down with nitrogen streams. About 5% aliquot dissolved in toluene was analyzed by GC-FID for quantification, and the remaining sample was analyzed using GC-C-IRMS. With each batch of samples, we prepared analytical blanks to check for potential contamination sources that might have come from solvents and reagents. Internal standards were added before and after the lipid extraction for quantification. 

The GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7683 B series gas chromatograph attached to an Agilent 5975 inert mass selective detector. Samples were injected in splitless mode at 320 Â°C, and compounds were separated with a VF-17ms column (60 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Î¼m film thickness). The carrier gas was helium set at a constant flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The temperature of the oven was set at 90 Â°C and held for 1 minute and then was increased at a rate of 5 Â°C/min to 320 Â°C, where it was held for 23 minutes. The GC-FID analysis for the FAME samples was carried out using Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a PTV inlet in splitless mode. The carrier gas was helium flowing at a rate of 1.6 ml/min. The GC system was an Agilent 6890N equipped with a programmed temperature vaporization (PTV) inlet in splitless mode. The GC oven was set at 90Â°C and held for 1.3 minute, and then was raised to 320Â°C at a rate of 5Â°C/min. The final temperature was set for 22 minutes. The GC-C-IRMS analyses of FAMEs of individual fatty acids were conducted using a Thermo Delta V Plus mass spectrometer linked to a GC Trace 1310 through an Isolink Interface. The sample injection volume was 1 ul in toluene and was injected in splitless mode. Separation was carried out using the same model of column for GC-MS and the GC oven temperature was set at 90 Â°C for 1.5 minutes and then was raised at a rate of 5 Â°C/min to 320 Â°C, with an 18-minute hold. Helium was used as a gas carrier with a constant flow rate of 1.24 ml/minute.

The GC-MS analysis for organic residues extracted from potsherds found at the Guijiabao and Gaoshan sites revealed that the presence of lipid compounds were above interpretable concentrations (5 Î¼g/g) [@Evershed2008experimental], but were in relatively small amounts in the majority of the potsherds (Table \@ref(tab:FA-composition-table)]. The lipid profiles show that the main compounds in most potsherds were saturated fatty acids with an even number of carbons, particularly C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), and monounsaturated fatty acid C18:1 (oleic acid) (Figure \@ref(fig:chromatograms-plots-four)). These fatty acids commonly exist in animal fat and plant oil. They are also generally degraded from larger molecules, such as triacylglycerols, due to oxidation and microbial degradation after long-term burial processes [@Dudd1998; @Eerkens2007]. High concentrations of medium-chain fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0) with an even-over-odd carbon chain length predominance indicate that the organic residues in our potsherds were highly degraded during post-depositional processes. In addition, a number of potsherds had higher contents of C18:1 compared to C18:0 and C16:0, such as SYG-TN13-E23-3. A higher content of C18:1 and C16:0 with a lower content of C18:0 might indicate the origin of plant oils [@Mayyas2018; @Copley2005]. However, we may still need to examine their isotopic values to confirm their sources.

One pottery sample (SYG-TN13-E22-2#2) has much higher lipid concentrations (about `r FA_max_sum` Î¼g/g) than the rest of the samples. A high yield of lipids might relate to the texture and type of ceramic used or better archaeological contexts for preservation. This sample also has a charred interior surface, indicative of a function associated with food processing. Long-chain fatty acids from C20:0 to C32:0 are present in that sample, with an even-over-odd carbon chain length predominance, but in lower amounts than in medium-chain components (Figure \@ref(fig:chromatograms-specific)). The existence of long-chain fatty acids with a high amount of C16:0 relative to C18:0 might be related to plant waxes [@Post1996; @Copley2005]. However, it could also be associated with degraded animal fat based on a strong predominance of medium-chain fatty acids [@Whelton2018; @Dudd1998]. Overall, the GC-MS results demonstrate strong evidence of degraded animal fats.

To identify the sources of degraded animal fats, we conducted isotope analysis to obtain stable carbon isotope compositions, Î´^13^C values of C16:0 and C18:0, using GC-C-IRMS. The Î´^13^C values of C16:0 and C18:0 have proven useful to distinguish between ruminant adipose, non-ruminant adipose, and ruminant dairy fats based on the different ways dietary carbon sources are utilized by different fat types [@Dunne2012; @Copley2003; @Evershed2008]. To reduce the bias caused by differential Î´^13^C values across geographical regions, we used the Î”^13^C (Î´^13^C18:0 - Î´^13^C16:0) values to determine the sources of degraded fats [@Evershed2008; @Salque2013]. The carbon isotope values for C16:0 and C18:0 have a distribution between `r min_carbon_isotope` and `r max_carbon_isotope`, and their Î”13C values range from `r delta_min` â€° to `r delta_max` â€°. The Î”13C values were plotted according to the global reference database for the identification of their origins [@Suryanarayan2021; @Dunne2012; @Evershed2008]. 

The results show that the majority of the potsherd samples from the Guijiabao site contain fatty acids from ruminant adipose fats, with one potsherd sample (SYG-TN13-E23-3) indicating a non-ruminant adipose fat origin (Figure \@ref(fig:isotopic-plots): A). Analysis of the potsherd from the Gaoshan site (CDG-062) indicates ruminant adipose fats as well. The potsherds (SYG-TN13-E22-1 and SYG-3) from the Guijiabao site dating to the historical period were plotted on the reference line between ruminant adipose and non-ruminant, indicative of the mixing of these two origins [@Copley2003; @Dudd1998milk; @Suryanarayan2021]. Furthermore, the potsherd representing non-ruminant adipose fats has a relatively low 13C value (Figure \@ref(fig:isotopic-plots): B), which is consistent with the value range of C3/terrestrial plants or freshwater fish [@Shoda2018; @Kwak2020]. This also corresponds to the lipid distribution of the same potsherd detected by GC-MS, reflecting a possible plant origin based on the GC-MS results. Although the referenced isotopic values should be ideally adjusted in terms of local environments, they could still provide useful information for determining food categories. 

In general, most potsherd samples containing ruminant adipose fats have depleted Î´^13^C values consistent with the Î´^13^C values of C3/terrestrial plants, suggesting these ruminant animals seemed to have consumed mainly C3 plants. There is only one Neolithic potsherd (SYG-TN13-E22-2#2) with a relatively large Î´^13^C value, suggesting a C4-based diet for the ruminant animal.

# Discussion
<!--A brief summary of interesting results-->
The aim of this paper is to explore whether new crops, such as C4 plants (e.g., millets) or C3 plants (e.g., rice), or animals (e.g., pigs/horses) became an essential part of the local diet in Yanyuan during the Neolithic period. Our results show that food residues in potsherds from the sites at Guijiabao and Gaoshan were dominated by ruminant fats during the Neolithic period. Moreover, it is striking to discover that non-ruminant fats in a Guijiabao potsherd might have originated from C3 plants (see below). Although the lipid yields in most of our samples are generally low, interpretative amounts of yields from all of our samples support the assumption that these ceramics were used as cooking or storage vesssels. The low lipid yield could be attributed to the bottom of the vessels, where there were fewer residues than other parts of the vessel, for example, the rim [@Evershed2008experimental; @Kwak2020; @Charters1993]. But we also found that one sample from the vessel bottom dated to the Neolithic period contains a richer composition of long-chain fatty acids compared with those in other samples, reflecting better preservation or a much higher lipid yield. We recognize that there are limitations and challenges for determining lipid sources over time or differences across regions due to our small sample sizes and a lack of local modern references for animal fats and plant oils. In addition, a detailed analysis of faunal remains from the Guijiabao site is still in progress, which may constrain a comprehensive comparison between different types of evidence. Nevertheless, the general pattern of lipid profiles could still provide informative clues for a better understanding of culinary practices at the Guijiabao site.

<!--discussion about possible plant origins-->
While it has been determined that millets (C4 plants), including foxtail and broomcorn millets, were the dominant cereals, according to recent macro-botanical and phytolith studies at Guijiabao [@Guijiabao2016; @Hao2022; @Huan2022], we did not detect any lipid residues associated with C4 plants in our samples. Surprisingly, we identified non-ruminant fats from a Guijiabao potsherd that might have been from terrestrial plants/C3 plants, based on similar isotopic values reported by other studies in East Asia [@Shoda2018; @Kwak2020]. According to the results from flotation analysis at the Guijiabao site, it is possible that the source of C3 plants is rice or native wild weeds, such as pennisetum and chenopodiaceae. However, the seeds of wild weeds only account for a small part of the floral assemblage derived from flotation [@Guijiabao2016]. Despite stone knives and tools that were also found at the sites that might have been related to farming practices, more studies are needed to confirm their usage for harvesting crops [@Zhou2019; @Hao2022; @Lin2022]. Another possible source for non-ruminant fats could have been freshwater fish, a possibility which can be supported by the finding of fish bones and net sinkers at Guijiabao [@Guijiabao2017b]. But we did not identify any lipid biomarkers related to aquatic resources, such as long-chain $\omega$-(o-alkylphenyl) alkanoic acids or phytanic acid, from our potsherds [@Evershed2008marine; @Hansel2004; @Cramp2014; @Lucquin2016]. 

<!--discussion about possible ruminant fat origin-->
The ruminant fats identified in the Neolithic potsherds (ca. 4500 BP) from the Guijiabao and Gaoshan sites could have been derived from deer, sheep, or horses that were fed on a C3 diet, based on their isotopic values that are consistent with global references [@Evershed2002; @Mileto2017]. This finding, especially the consumption of deer, also corresponds with unearthed faunal remains from the sites and the local natural environments. Stone artifacts found at the site, including stone balls and arrowheads, further indicate hunting activities [@Hao2022; @Guijiabao2020a]. However, whether horse was part of local food choices in southwest China around 4500 years ago is doubtful. First, the Pleistocene and Neolithic sites having wild horse bones are primarily concentrated in northern China, with only sporadic sites in the south [@Yuan2006]. Second, domesticated horses first found in southwest China date to the Dian culture (4th century BC to 1st century AD) in eastern Yunnan [@Lei2009; @Chiou2004], which is 3000 years later than the Neolithic period that we are focusing on. Thus, supported by faunal evidence, deer was most likely the predominant local food choices. It is also possible that local wild bovids, such as yaks or water buffalo, were food sources during this period, as these animals have been found in sites in southwest China [@Zhang2016; @Chen2020].

We observed a mixture of ruminant fats and C3 plants, based on analyses of a number of Guijiabao potsherds that date to the historical period (ca. 1000 BP). It appears that C3 plants could have been processed more in the historical period than they could have been in the Neolithic period. In addition to rice, the source of C3 plants could also have included wheat, since it was introduced during the historical period [@JiangGaoshan2017]. A larger sample size is needed to determine whether there was a change in diet over time. The overall depleted Î´^13^C values for potsherd samples associated with ruminant fats suggest that C3 plants might have been an important food source for local animals. Despite direct C4 plant signals not being found, analysis of one Guijiabao potsherd shows the source of C4 plant-fed ruminants during the Neolithic period. This indicates that either C3 or C4 plants could have been the food source for ruminants, but whether those animals were domesticated is unknown. The zooarchaeological analysis of faunal bones from Guijiabao is still in progress, the results of which which could provide more details about local animal species for comparison.

In general, based on our results, ruminant fats from local wild animals, such as deer, were the predominant food source during the Neolithic period for peoples at Guijiabao. A subsistence that relied on hunting to a certain degree could be plausible, given the abundance of wild animals in the natural settings of the Hengduan mountain ranges, as indicated by the faunal remains from the Yingpanshan site [@He2020]. Crop cultivation could have been adopted as a supplement to local food sources when it was introduced in the Neolithic period, but crops might have only accounted for a small proportion of the food sources. A previous study using isotopic analysis of human bones suggests that the diet at the Guijiabao site was a C4-based diet [@Lin2022], but we only identified a signal from C3 plants from one pottery sample without any signal from C4 plants. This inconsistency could have resulted from different sampling strategies or from the sample size issue, where our results reflect only a small portion of food content. Nevertheless, our results suggest that farming practices during the Neolithic period might not have been adopted as much as we previously thought. An approach analyzing organic residues may only provide a narrow perspective on local diets, but it could improve our current understanding of food practices through presence of food residues that were cooked in ceramic vessels. A large-scale organic residue analysis of ceramics across different pottery forms in a wider region would offer insight into temporal and regional variations in the local diet during the Neolithic period in southwest China.

# Conclusion
Our case study on organic residues in pottery fragments from the sites at Guijiabao and Gaoshan in southwest China reveals the presence of lipids that can be analyzed to determine food sources. The foods cooked in the ceramics included ruminant fats and terrestrial plants during the Neolithic period, when millet and rice spread into southwest China. The source of terrestrial plants could have been C3 plants, implying the cooking of rice or other wild weeds in the pots. However, the evidence of direct cooking of either C3 or C4 plants shows that the amount of C3/C4 plants cooked is not in proportion to the large quantity of plant remains found at the Guijiabao site, especially C4 plants such as millet. Instead, ruminant fats from local animals, such as wild deer, could have been a common food source during the Neolithic period. This suggests that hunting might have been an important part of local subsistence strategy, supplemented by rice/millet farming when they were introduced. Our results from the Guijiabao site could represent a subsistence strategy for adapting to the natural environment of the Hengduan Mountains. We recognize the limitations of our interpretation of the local diet due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, our study could offer an approach using organic residue analysis to determine food choices and explore the extent of the adoption of farming when rice/millet agriculture first spread into the Yanyuan area during the Neolithic period. A more systematic sampling of potsherds across different phases and pottery types may give a clear picture of diet and subsistence in southwest China during the Neolithic period of transition.
